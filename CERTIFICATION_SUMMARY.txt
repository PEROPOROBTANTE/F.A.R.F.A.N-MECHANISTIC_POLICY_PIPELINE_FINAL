WARNINGS (NON-CRITICAL)
================================================================================

⚠️  Warning 1: Global metrics singleton
    Impact: LOW (monitoring only, not execution control)
    Mitigation: Acceptable design pattern for metrics
    Action: NONE REQUIRED

⚠️  Warning 2: Shared global_causal_graph in FrontierExecutorOrchestrator
    Impact: LOW (controlled batch execution only)
    Mitigation: Sequential execution prevents conflicts
    Action: NONE REQUIRED

EXECUTION FLOW (VERIFIED)
================================================================================

1. Document → Orchestrator.process_development_plan()
2. Phase 2 triggered → _execute_micro_questions_async()
3. For each question → appropriate executor selected
4. Executor.execute(doc, method_executor) called
5. execute_with_optimization() processes method_sequence
6. For each method:
   - _prepare_arguments() resolves parameters
   - method_executor.execute() invokes method
   - _update_argument_context() updates state
7. Results aggregated and returned

ISOLATION: Each question gets its own executor instance
CONCURRENCY: Phases execute sequentially, not concurrently
CONFLICTS: None detected
