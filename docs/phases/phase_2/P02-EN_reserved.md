# P02-EN (Reserved) — Phase 2 Structural Placeholder

- **Node ID:** N2  
- **Status:** Reserved / No active implementation  
- **Mandate:** This file and its Spanish counterpart mark Phase 2 as a structural placeholder only. No production code, contracts, or traces may reference N2 within the canonical graph `G`.  
- **Rules:**  
  - Any experimental work related to future Phase 2 must live under `docs/phases/experimental/phase_2/` (not present yet) and a separate graph `G_exp`.  
  - Until this document is replaced by a full doctrine (EN+ES, graphs, contracts), N2 must not appear in `N_active`.  
- **Action:** Keep this marker synchronized with `P02-ES_reserved.md`. Remove only when Phase 2 is formally defined.
