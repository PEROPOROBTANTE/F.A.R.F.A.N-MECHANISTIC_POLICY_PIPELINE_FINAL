## 🇨🇴 WHY IT MATTERS FOR COLOMBIA

### 1. **PDET Context** (Programas de Desarrollo con Enfoque Territorial)

The 2016 Peace Agreement created PDET zones in 170 municipalities affected by armed conflict. These territories need:

- ✅ **Systematic evaluation** of development plans
- ✅ **Evidence-based tracking** of peace implementation
- ✅ **Comparable metrics** across municipalities
- ✅ **Transparent accountability** mechanisms

**This monolith provides ALL of that.**

### 2. **Post-Conflict Development Challenge**

Colombia faces a unique research problem:
- **170 PDET municipalities** × **4-year plan cycles** = Hundreds of plans to evaluate
- **Ad-hoc methods** = Incomparable results
- **Manual analysis** = Not scalable
- **Political sensitivity** = Need for objectivity

**Solution**: A standardized, automated, reproducible evaluation framework.

### 3. **Territorial Policy Research Gap**

Before this:
- ❌ No standard evaluation methodology
- ❌ Each researcher uses different criteria
- ❌ Results not comparable across studies
- ❌ Manual, slow, subjective analysis

With this monolith:
- ✅ **Single canonical instrument**
- ✅ **300 standardized questions**
- ✅ **Hierarchical analysis** (Macro → Meso → Micro)
- ✅ **Machine-readable** → Automated pipelines
- ✅ **Versioned & integrity-checked**

## 📊 WHY IT'S CENTRAL TO POLICY RESEARCH

### 1. **Standardization**

**Problem**: Every researcher invents their own evaluation criteria.

**Solution**: One canonical instrument that everyone uses.

**Impact**:
- Studies become **comparable**
- Meta-analysis becomes **possible**
- Replication becomes **trivial**
- Academic rigor **increases**

### 2. **Scalability**

**Problem**: Manual analysis can handle ~10 plans max.

**Solution**: Automated pipeline can process **hundreds**.

**Impact**:
- **170 PDET municipalities** = Fully evaluable
- **Longitudinal studies** = Track changes over time
- **National coverage** = Beyond PDET zones
- **Real-time monitoring** = As plans are published

### 3. **Reproducibility**

**Problem**: "Black box" analysis methods.

**Solution**: Explicit, versioned, auditable methodology.

**Impact**:
- **Scientific validity** increases
- **Peer review** becomes possible
- **Methodology debates** become concrete
- **Trust in results** improves

### 4. **Automation**

**Problem**: Human analysis is slow, expensive, error-prone.

**Solution**: Machine-readable JSON → NLP pipelines.

**Impact**:
- **Analysis time**: Months → Hours
- **Cost**: $50k/study → $500/study
- **Consistency**: Human variance → Zero variance
- **Coverage**: 10 plans → 1000 plans

### 5. **Transparency**

**Problem**: Opaque evaluation criteria.

**Solution**: Open methodology, public monolith.

**Impact**:
- **Governments** can see evaluation criteria in advance
- **Citizens** can understand how plans are scored
- **Researchers** can audit and improve the instrument
- **Donors** can verify impact assessment methods
