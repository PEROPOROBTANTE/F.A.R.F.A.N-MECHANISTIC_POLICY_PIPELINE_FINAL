Processing Layer Test Suite

Property-based tests using Hypothesis for semantic chunking determinism,
SPC ingestion pipeline idempotency, embedding policy consistency, and converter invariants.
Plus integration tests for quality gates, policy processor end-to-end execution,
and aggregation pipeline correctness.

Test Files:
- test_semantic_chunking_properties.py: Semantic chunking determinism
- test_spc_ingestion_properties.py: SPC ingestion idempotency
- test_embedding_policy_properties.py: Embedding consistency
- test_converter_properties.py: Converter invariants (to be created)
- test_quality_gates_integration.py: Quality gates integration (to be created)
- test_policy_processor_integration.py: End-to-end policy processing (to be created)
- test_aggregation_integration.py: Aggregation pipeline (to be created)
